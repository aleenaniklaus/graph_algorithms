Hi Aleena!

Thanks for setting up the GitLab project and walking me through some of the basics.
That's fun! There are a lot of ways to handle graphs in Python, it seems.

As we discussed today, let's just have you kind of try each of them out on your
own this week, and next week we can touch base and you can show me which one you
think you'd like to work in most.  If you can, see if you can have some examples
of graphs that we can run an algorithm or two on, or maybe that we can have the
computer draw them for us, etc.

Once that's in place, we can focus on some interesting (possibly new) algorithm
and figure out some details of how it works and such.
